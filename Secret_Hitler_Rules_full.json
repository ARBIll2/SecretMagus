      "text": "The year is 1932. The place is pre\n \n-WWII Germany. \nIn \n \nSecret Hitler\n \n, players are German politicians \nattempting to hold a fragile Liberal government \ntogether and stem the rising tide of Fascism. \nWatch out thoughŠthere are secret Fascists among \nyou, and one player is Secret Hitler.\nOV ERVI EW\nAt the beginning of the game, each player \nis secretly assigned to one of three roles: \n \nLiberal\n \n, \nFascist\n \n, or \n \nHitler\n \n. The Liberals have \na majority, but they don™t know for sure who \nanyone is; Fascists must resort to secrecy and \nsabotage to accomplish their goals. Hitler plays \nfor the Fascist team, and the Fascists know \nHitler™s identity from the outset, but Hitler \ndoesn™t know the Fascists and must work to \nfigure them out.\nThe Liberals win by \n \nenacting five Liberal \nPolicies\n \n or \n \nkilling Hitler\n \n. The Fascists win by \n \nenacting six Fascist Policies\n \n, or \n \nif Hitler is \nelected Chancellor\n \n after three Fascist Policies \nhave been enacted.\nWhenever a Fascist Policy is enacted, the \ngovernment becomes more powerful, and the \nPresident is granted a single-use power which \nmust be used before the next round can begin. It \ndoesn™t matter what team the President is on; in \nfact, even Liberal players might be tempted to \nenact a Fascist Policy to gain new powers. \nOBJECT\nEvery player has a secret identity as a member \nof either the Liberal team or the Fascist team.\nPlayers on the Liberal team win if either:\nŁ \nFive Liberal Policies are enacted.\nOR\nŁ \nHitler is assassinated.\nPlayers on the Fascist team win if either:\nŁ \nSix Fascist Policies are enacted.\nOR\nŁ \nHitler is elected Chancellor any time \n \nafter \n \nthe third Fascist Policy has been enacted.\nGAME CONTENTS\n17\n ..........

      "text": "WHY ARE THERE SECRET ROLE AND PARTY \nMEMBERSHIP CARDS?\nSecret Hitler features an investigation \nmechanic that allows some players to \nfind out what team other players are \non, and this mechanic only works if \nHitler™s special role is not revealed. \nTo prevent that from happening, every \nplayer has both a Secret Role card \nand a Party Membership card. Hitler™s \nParty Membership card shows a Fascist \nparty loyalty, but gives no hint about \na special role. Liberals who uncover \nFascists must work out for themselves \nwhether they™ve found an ordinary \nFascist or their leader. \nOnce each player has been dealt an envelope, \nall players should examine their Secret Role \ncards in secret. Randomly select the first \nPresidential Candidate and pass that player both \nthe President and Chancellor placards.\nGET THE APP:\n \nGo to secrethitler.com/app \nto get a companion app that can narrate \nthese directions for you.\nFor games of 5-6 players\n, give the following \ndirections to all players:\nŁ \nEverybody close your eyes.\nŁ \nFascist and Hitler, open your eyes and \nacknowledge each other. \n[\nTake a long pause]\nŁ\n \nEveryone close your eyes.\nŁ \nEveryone can open your eyes. If anyone is \nconfused or something went wrong, please tell \nthe group now.\nFor games of 7-10 players\n, give the following \ndirections to all players: \nŁ \nE\nverybody close your eyes and extend your hand \ninto a fist in front of you.\nŁ \nAll Fascists who are NOT Hitler should open \ntheir eyes and acknowledge each other. \nŁ \nHitler - keep your eyes closed but put your \nthumb out into a thumbs-up gesture.\nŁ \nFascists, take note of who has an extended \nthumb - that player is Hitler.\n[\nTake a long pause]\nŁ\n \nEveryone close your eyes and put your\nhands down.\nŁ \nEveryone can open your eyes. If anyone is \nconfused or something went wrong, please tell \nthe group now.\nGAMEPLAY\nSecret Hitler is played in rounds. Each round \nhas an \nElection\n to form a government, a \nLegislative Session\n to enact a new Policy, and a n  \nExecutive Action\n to exercise governmental power.\nELECTION\n \n1. \nPass the Presidential Candidacy\nAt the beginning of a new round, the President \nplacard moves clockwise to the next player, who \nis the new Presidential Candidate.\n2.\n Nominate a Chancellor\nThe Presidential Candidate chooses a Chancellor \nCandidate by passing the Chancellor placard \nto \nany other eligible player. The Presidential \nCandidate is free to discuss Chancellor options \nwith the table to build consensus and make it \nmore likely the Government gets elected.\nEligibility:\nThe last \nelected\n President and Chancellor are \nﬁterm-limited,ﬂ and ineligible to be nominated \nas Chancellor Candidate.\nO\nN ELIGIBILITY:\n \nŁ\n \nTerm limits apply to the President and \nChancellor who were last elected, not to the \nlast pair nominated. \n"

      "text": "Ł\n \nTerm limits only affect nominations to the \nChancellorship; anyone can be President, even \nsomeone who was just Chancellor.\nŁ\n \nIf there are only five players left in the \ngame,\n \n only the last elected \n \nChancellor \n \nis \nineligible to be Chancellor Candidate; the \nlast President may be nominated.\nŁ\n \nThere are some other rules that affect \neligibility in specific ways: the Veto Power \nand the Election Tracker. You don™t need to \nworry about those yet, and we™ll talk about \neach one in its relevant section.\n3. \nVote on the government\nOnce the Presidential Candidate has chosen \nan \neligible Chancellor Candidate, players may \ndiscuss the proposed government until everyone \nis ready to vote. Every player, \nincluding the \nCandidates\n, votes on the proposed government. \nOnce everyone is ready to vote, reveal your \nBallot cards simultaneously so that everyone™s \nvote is public.\nIf the vote is a tie, or if a majority of \nplayers votes no:\nThe vote fails. The Presidential Candidate \nmisses this chance to be elected, and the \nPresident placard moves clockwise to the next \nplayer. The Election Tracker is advanced by\none Election.\nElection Tracker:\n If the group rejects three \ngovernments in a row, the country is thrown into \nchaos. Immediately reveal the Policy on top of \nthe Policy deck and enact it. Any power granted \nby this Policy is ignored, but the Election \nTracker resets, and existing term-limits are \nforgotten. \n \nAll players \n \nbecome eligible to hold \nthe office of Chancellor for the next Election. \nIf there are fewer than three tiles remaining in \nthe Policy deck at this point, shuffle them with \nthe Discard pile to create a new Policy deck.\nAny time a new Policy tile is played face-up, \nthe Election Tracker is reset, whether it was \nenacted by an elected government or enacted by \nthe frustrated populace.\nIf a majority of players votes yes:\n \nT\nhe Presidential Candidate and Chancellor \nCandidate become the new President and \nChancellor, respectively.\n \n \nIf three or more Fascist Policies have been \nenacted already:\nAsk if the new Chancellor is Hitler. If \nso, the game is over and the Fascists win. \nOtherwise,  other players know for sure the \nChancellor is not Hitler.\n \nProceed as usual to the Legislative Session.\nLEGISLATIVE SESSION\nDuring the Legislative Session, the President \nand Chancellor work together to enact a new \nPolicy in secret. The President draws the top \nthree tiles from the Policy deck, looks at them \nin secret, and discards one tile face down into \nthe Discard pile. The remaining two tiles go to \nthe Chancellor, who looks in secret, discards \none Policy tile face down, and enacts the \nremaining Policy by placing the tile face up on \nthe corresponding track.\nVerbal and nonverbal communication between the \nPresident and Chancellor is forbidden. The \nPresident and Chancellor MAY NOT pick Policies \nto play at random, shuffle the tiles before \ndiscarding one, or do anything else clever to \navoid secretly and intentionally selecting a \nPolicy. Additionally, the President should hand \nboth Policies over at the same time, rather \nthan one at a time to gauge the Chancellor™s \nreaction. Attempting to telegraph the contents \nof your hand using randomness or any other \nunusual selection procedure violates the spirit \nof the game. Don™t do it.\nDiscarded Policy tiles should never be revealed \nto the group. Players must rely on the word of \nthe President and Chancellor, who are free to \nlie.\n"

      "text": "ABOUT LYING:\n Often, some players learn \nthings that the rest of the players \ndon™t know, like when the President and \nChancellor get to see Policy tiles, or \nwhen a President uses the Investigate \npower to see someone™s Party Membership \ncard. You can always lie about hidden \nknowledge in Secret Hitler. The only time \nplayers MUST tell the truth is in game-\nending, Hitler-related scenarios: a player \nwho is Hitler must say so if assassinated \nor if elected Chancellor after three \nFascist Policies have been enacted.\nIf there are fewer than three tiles remaining \nin the Policy deck at the end of a Legislative \nSession\n, shuffle them with the Discard pile to \ncreate a new Policy deck. Unused Policy tiles \nshould never \n \nbe revealed, and they should \n \nnot\n \n \n \nbe \nsimply placed on top of the new Policy deck.\nIf the government enacted a Fascist Policy that \ncovered up a Presidential Power\n, the sitting \nPresident gets to use that power. Proceed to the \nExecutive Action.\nIf the government enacted a Liberal Policy or \na Fascist Policy that grants no Presidential \nPower,\n begin a new round with a new Election.  \nEXECUTIVE ACTION\nIf the newly-enacted Fascist Policy grants a \nPresidential Power, the President \n \nmust use it \nbefore the next round can begin. Before using \na power, the President is free to discuss the \nissue with other players, but ultimately the \nPresident gets to decide how and when the power \nis used. Gameplay cannot continue until the \nPresident uses the power. Presidential Powers \nare used only once; they don™t stack or roll \nover to future turns.\nPRESIDENTIAL POWERS\nInvestigate Loyalty\nThe President chooses a player to \ninvestigate. Investigated players \nshould hand their Party Membership \ncard (not Secret Role card!) to the \nPresident, who checks the player™s \nloyalty in secret and then returns \nthe card to the player. The President \nmay share (or lie about!) the \nresults of their investigation at \ntheir discretion. No player may be \ninvestigated twice in the same game.\nCall Special Election\nThe President chooses any other \nplayer at the table to be the next \nPresidential Candidate by passing \nthat player the President placard. \nAny player can become PresidentŠeven \nplayers that are term-limited. The \nnew President nominates an eligible \nplayer as Chancellor Candidate and \nthe Election proceeds as usual. \nA Special Election does not skip any \nplayers. After a Special Election, \nthe President placard returns to the \nleft of the President who enacted the \nSpecial Election. \nIf the President passes the \npresidency to the next player in the \nrotation, that player would get to \nrun for President twice in a row: \nonce for the Special Election and \nonce for their normal shift in the \nPresidential rotation.\nPolicy Peek\nThe President secretly looks at the \ntop three tiles in the Policy deck and \nthen returns them to the top of the \ndeck without changing the order.\nExecution\nThe President executes one player \nat the table by saying ﬁI formally \nexecute [player name].ﬂ If that \nplayer is Hitler, the game ends in \na Liberal victory. If the executed \nplayer is \n \nnot \n \nHitler, the table \nshould \nnot\n learn whether a Fascist or \na Liberal has been killed; players \nmust try to work out for themselves \nthe new table balance. Executed \nplayers are removed from the game and \nmay not speak, vote, or run\nfor office.\n"

      "text": "VETO POWER\nThe Veto Power is a special rule that comes into \neffect after five Fascist Policies have been \n\nenacted. For all Legislative Sessions after the \n\nfifth Fascist Policy is enacted, the Executive \n\nbranch gains a \npermanent new ability\n to discard \nall three Policy tiles if \nboth\n the Chancellor \nand President agree.\nThe President draws three Policy tiles, \ndiscards one, and passes the remaining two to \n\nthe Chancellor as usual. Then Chancellor may, \n\ninstead of enacting either Policy, say ﬁI wish \n\nto veto this agenda.ﬂ If the President consents \n\nby saying, ﬁI agree to the veto,ﬂ both Policies \n\nare discarded and the President placard passes \nto the left as usual. If the President \n \ndoes not \nconsent, the Chancellor must enact a Policy\n\nas normal.\nEach use of the Veto Power represents an \ninactive government and advances the Election \n\nTracker by one.\nSTRATEGY NOTES\nŁ\nEveryone should claim to be a Liberal.\n Since\nthe Liberal team has a voting majority, it can\n\neasily shut out any player claiming to be a\n\nFascist. As a Fascist, there is no advantage to\n\nouting yourself to the majority. Additionally,\n\nLiberals should usually tell the truth. Liberals\n\nare trying to figure out the game like a puzzle,\nso lying can put their team at a \nsignificant \n \ndisadvantage.\nŁ\nIf this is your first time playing Hitler,\njust remember: be as Liberal as possible.\n Enact\nLiberal Policies. Vote for Liberal governments.\n\nKiss babies. Trust your fellow Fascists to\n\ncreate opportunities for you to enact Liberal\n\nPolicies and to advance Fascism on their turns.\n\nThe Fascists win by subtly manipulating the\n\ntable and waiting for the right cover to enact\n\nFascist Policies, not by overtly playing\n\nas evil.\nŁ\nLiberals frequently benefit from slowing play\ndown and discussing the available information.\nFascists frequently benefit from rushing votes\n\nand creating confusion.\nŁ\nFascists most often win by electing Hitler,\nnot by enacting six Policies!\n Electing Hitler\nisn™t an optional or secondary win condition,\n\nit™s the core of a successful Fascist strategy.\n\nHitler should always play as a Liberal, and\n\nshould generally avoid lying or getting into\n\nfights and disagreements with other players.\n\nWhen the time comes, Hitler needs the Liberals™\n\ntrust to get elected. Even if Hitler isn™t\n\nultimately elected, the distrust sown among\n\nLiberals is key to getting Fascists elected late\n\nin the game.\nŁ\nAsk other players to explain why they took\nan action.\n This is especially important with\nPresidential PowersŠin fact, ask ahead of time\nwhom a candidate is thinking of investigating/\nappointing/assassinating.\nŁ\nIf a Fascist Policy comes up, there are only\nthree possible culprits: The President, the\nChancellor, or the Policy Deck.\n Try to figure\nout who (or what!) put you in this position.\nTHANK YOU\nMike, Tommy, and Mac would like to thank:\nShari Spiro, Dan Shapiro, Elan Lee, Mike \nSelinker, Luke Crane and everyone else at \nKickstarter, everyone who contributed a quote \nto the Kickstarter, The Cards Against Humanity \nstaff.\nThanks to our early playtesters: Karlee, Tom, \nMaria, Trin, Andy, Cory, Katie, Veronica, Sandy, \nGreg, Andrew, and everyone else who helped us \nrefine the earliest versions of the game.\nMost especially, thank you to our 34,565 backers \nwho helped us make this game a reality.\n"
