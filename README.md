# Secret Hitler Webapp Scaffold

This project lays the groundwork for a multiplayer implementation of **Secret Hitler** using React for the client and Node.js with socket.io for the server.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js + socket.io
- **Shared**: Common constants and utilities across client and server

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies (add packages as you build):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `client/index.html` in a browser with a bundler or dev server of choice.

This repository only contains scaffolding and TODOs. Follow comments in each file to gradually implement full game logic and a richer UI.
