# Secret Hitler Rule Summary

## Overview
Secret Hitler is a hidden identity game set in pre-WWII Germany. Players are secretly divided into Liberal and Fascist teams. One Fascist is "Hitler." Liberals have a voting majority but do not know who anyone is. Fascists know who Hitler is (and each other for 7–10 player games), but Hitler only knows the Fascists in 5–6 player games. The goal is to enact policies and use deduction to achieve your team's win condition.

## Components
- 11 Fascist Policy tiles
- 6 Liberal Policy tiles
- 10 Secret Role cards
- 10 Party Membership cards
- 10 Ja! ballot cards
- 10 Nein ballot cards
- 10 card envelopes
- 3 Fascist boards (for different player counts)
- Liberal board, President placard, Chancellor placard, draw/discard markers, election tracker

## Role Distribution
| Players | Liberals | Fascists | Hitler |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| 5 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| 7 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 8 | 5 | 2 | 1 |
| 9 | 5 | 3 | 1 |
| 10 | 6 | 3 | 1 |

## Setup
1. Choose the Fascist board that matches the player count.
2. Shuffle all 17 Policy tiles together face down to form the draw pile.
3. For each player prepare an envelope with a Secret Role card, matching Party Membership card, and one Ja!/Nein ballot pair. Shuffle envelopes and deal one to each player.
4. Randomly select the first Presidential Candidate and give them both placards.
5. Players secretly look at their role cards.
6. Conduct the initial "eyes closed" sequence:
   - **5–6 players:** Fascist and Hitler open eyes and acknowledge each other.
   - **7–10 players:** Fascists (not Hitler) open eyes and see each other while Hitler keeps eyes closed with a thumbs up so Fascists learn who Hitler is.

## Game Phases
Each round has three phases.

### 1. Election
1. Pass the presidency clockwise to the next player.
2. The Presidential Candidate nominates an eligible Chancellor.
3. All players (including candidates) vote Ja! or Nein simultaneously.
4. If majority votes Ja!, the government is formed. If three or more Fascist policies are already enacted, check whether the new Chancellor is Hitler—if so, Fascists win.
5. If a majority votes Nein or a tie occurs, the election fails: move the election tracker one space, pass the presidency, and if the tracker reaches three, automatically enact the top policy (no power) and reset the tracker with term limits cleared.

### Chancellor Eligibility
- The last **elected** President and Chancellor cannot be nominated as Chancellor.
- If only five players remain alive, only the last elected Chancellor is ineligible.

### 2. Legislative Session
1. President draws three Policy tiles; if fewer than three remain, shuffle discards to form a new deck.
2. President discards one face down and passes the other two to the Chancellor in secret.
3. Chancellor discards one face down and enacts the remaining Policy face up.
4. President and Chancellor may not reveal or randomize cards to signal; discarded tiles remain secret.

### 3. Executive Action
If the enacted Fascist policy grants a power, the President must immediately use it before the next round. Powers do not stack.

## Presidential Powers
- **Investigate Loyalty:** View a player's Party Membership card in secret (not their Secret Role). A player cannot be investigated twice.
- **Call Special Election:** Choose any player to be the next Presidential Candidate. After that election, presidency returns to the left of the player who triggered it.
- **Policy Peek:** Secretly look at the top three Policy tiles and return them in the same order.
- **Execution:** Announce a player to kill. If the executed player is Hitler, Liberals win. Otherwise no affiliation is revealed and the player is removed from the game.

## Veto Power
After five Fascist policies are enacted, the President and Chancellor gain the permanent option to veto legislation:
1. During the Legislative Session the Chancellor may say "I wish to veto this agenda." 
2. If the President agrees, both policies are discarded, the election tracker advances by one, and the presidency passes left.
3. If the President declines, the Chancellor must enact one of the two policies normally.

## Win Conditions
- **Liberals win** by enacting five Liberal policies **or** killing Hitler.
- **Fascists win** by enacting six Fascist policies **or** electing Hitler Chancellor after three Fascist policies have been enacted.

## Additional Rules & Edge Cases
- Whenever a Fascist policy is enacted, the government becomes more powerful and may grant a Presidential Power as marked on the board.
- Players may lie about any hidden information except a player who is Hitler must truthfully reveal this if assassinated or when elected Chancellor after three Fascist policies.
- If the Policy deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.
- Discarded policy tiles and investigation results are never publicly revealed.
- Executed players cannot speak, vote, or hold office for the remainder of the game.
- The Election Tracker resets to zero whenever a policy is enacted (whether by government or by failed elections).
